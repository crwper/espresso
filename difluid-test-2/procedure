- Mark sample boats 1 through 10
- Dry at 350 F for 30 minutes
- Cool 10 minutes
- Weigh sample boats

- Grind Rooftop coffee at 1.25
- Whatman filter
- WDT; tamp twice at 30 lb
- 90 C water
- 18.06 g ground coffee in; 20.72 g out in 47.99 s
- Cool in room temperature bath 1 hour
- Filter with single layer of Chemex

- Coffee on 0.01 g scale
- Weighing boats on 0.001 g scale

- Check refractometer zero with distilled water

- Clean & blow dry refractometers
- Measure analog Brix & Difluid TDS/n/temp
- Repeat measurement 3 times

- Check milligram scale calibration with 10 g weight
- Record dry weight of boat
- Move 4 g of liquid to weighing boat, record weight
- Add distilled water to bring original back up to 20 g
- Stir with glass rod

- Clean transfer pipette
- Repeat for 10 samples

- Dry samples in oven at 212 F
- Weigh dried samples

- Room temperature 23.7 C
- Coffee temperature 23.3 C

- Trad refractometer is much easier to clean--maybe why we sometimes get non-zero distilled readings with DiFluid
    - Microfiber cloth included with DiFluid not absorbent enough--use loopy cloth
- Much harder to read trad refrac at filter concentrations
- No effort made to protect DiFluid from ambient light
- Should have dried some spare sample boats to use as replacements

- Samples in the oven at 212 F at 10:12
- Samples out of oven at 15:50
- Samples in oven at 05:30
- Pause at 10:00 to weigh
- Pause at 15:45 to weigh
